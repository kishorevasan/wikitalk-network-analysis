# Wiki-Talk Network Analysis

**Title:** Crawling Wikipedia Graph

**Collaborators:** Maria Mitkina (Foster Bussiness School), and Chase Gottlich (Institute of Health Metrics & Evaluation)

**Abstract:**

Mining large graphs reveals information; temporal network of the same reveal evolution. However, performing novel algorithms on these large graphs can be computationally expensive. We need methods that can provide an un-biased sample that would be representative of the underlying large network. In this work, we evaluate different random walks by crawling a large online editing network â€“ Wikipedia. 

**Findings:**

- Clustering of the graph associated with high growth in the platform.
- Simple Random Walk is ineffective when sampling graphs with high tailed distribution.
- Re-Weighted Random Walk outperforms other methods for graph sampling.
